Lab cycle 1
Sl no   	Question	Hours	Course outcome	Cognitive level
1	Sort a given set of elements using the Quicksort method
Determine the time required
to sort the elements.
Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of
elements in the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The elements
can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.	2	CO1,CO2	L3
2	Print all the nodes reachable from a given starting node in a digraph using BFS method	2	CO1,CO2	L3
3	Check whether a given graph is connected or not using DFS method	2	CO1,CO2	L3
4	From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices
